Welcome to the world of RPG Simulator, an immersive and dynamic role-playing game where you can embark on epic adventures, forge your own destiny, and become the hero you've always dreamed of. In this vast and intricate virtual realm, you'll find yourself surrounded by rich landscapes, captivating storylines, and a myriad of possibilities.

## Installation

Use the Cmake [cmake](https://cmake.org/) to install RPG Simulator. Once the CMake generation is complete, you can use the build system of your choice to compile the project. For example, if you're using Make as your build system, run the following command:
```bash
make 
```
This command will compile your project based on the generated Makefile.


After the compilation is successful, you can run your executable. Assuming the executable is named "myproject," run the following command:
```bash
./rpg_simulator
```
That's it! You've successfully used CMake to compile your project. Remember to re-run the CMake and compilation steps whenever you make changes to your CMakeLists.txt or source files.
